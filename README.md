# Pro Tailwind: Exctracting Reusable UI Components

// TODO: intro

---

## Workshop Outline

**1. Warm-up gymnastics!**

We don't want to pull a muscle going in cold. Before we dive into extracting UI components, let's warm those fingers up with some CSS challenges around the Booking UI app.

**2. Multi-theme support**

Once we're all warmed up, we'll dive into today's main topic. After checking that the Booking UI application is working locally, we'll identifying what parts of the UI we could abstract away into reusable UI components, and create a mini component library from it.

Here are a few things the process will cover:

## Who's the teacher?

Hey!

I'm Simon, and I will be your workshop instructor. If you've watched some YouTube videos from the Tailwind Labs channel, you've most probably seen my face already!

I love utility-first CSS. I've been supporting and promoting this styling approach even before Tailwind CSS existed!

I'm a front-end developer, designer and content creator. I bring a lot of entusiasm and positive energy in everything I do, this is just how I'm wired up!

I think I'm really good at teaching stuff, and make people excited to learn new things.

I have been teaching in-person workshops for multiple senior engineering teams (Atlassian), and a constant piece of feedback I get is my workshops are exciting, fun and engaging.

And to me, that's the best way to learn!

I've been speaking at conferences, meetups, and I'm also an instructor on egghead.io

Oh, and I recently started a podcast with my new friend Jon Myers - it's called The NavBar, you should check it out!

You can connect with me on Twitter, I'm [@simonswiss](https://twitter.com/simonswiss).

I'm super excited to dive into this workshop with you.
